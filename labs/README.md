# Labs

The Bomb-Lab, Math-Chals, Angry-Chals, and Arm-Chals Labs can be built using our [build environment](../build/) to generate unique binaries. Links to the labs and templates follow below.


| Lab         | Description | 
|-------------|-------------|
| [Bomb-Lab Template](../build/templates/bomb-lab)            | Traditional computer science program that consists of five levels, each that requested specific user input to successfully disarm the bomb.  |
| [Math-Chals Template](../build/templates/math-chals)        | Introduces students to static analysis by examining assembly instructions. |
| [Networking-Annotation-Lab](networking-lab)                 | Lab consists of developing a plugin that annotated the networking calls from a disassembled binary. |
| [Angry-Chals Template](../build/templates/angry-chals)       | Introduces students to symbolic execution as a tertiary analysis method for reverse engineering.|
| [Arm-Chals Template](../build/templates/arm-chals)          | Consists of similar problems to the previous labs but compiled the programs as ARM64 binaries |
